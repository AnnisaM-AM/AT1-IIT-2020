    <h1>My Profile</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Name: Annisa Maharanti</p>
    <p>Student Number: s3724269</p>
    <p>Age: 20</p>
    <p>Cultural Background: Indonesian</p>
    <p>Nationality: Australian</p>
    <p>In addition to the basic information stated above, education wise, I completed secondary education or high school in 2017 and proceeded to attempt an Advanced Diploma of Engineering (Aeronautical) at RMIT the following year before enrolling in the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT through Open University Australia this year. I often find myself spending my free time by watching K-Dramas, which stands for Korean Dramas, or watching comedic content on YouTube. I find myself still figuring out what my hobbies are or what my hobbies can potentially be, so I wouldn’t say that I have specific hobbies, but I do enjoy learning how to cook currently.</p>
    
    <h2>Interest In IT</h2>
    <p>I began to be interested in IT while I was trying to decide if I should continue my Advanced Diploma, as I started to feel that the Aeronautical Engineering course was not for me. I have been quite exposed to the world of programming and IT since I was young, as my father works as a software developer. So, while I was figuring out where my interests lay career-wise, I became intrigued with my father’s work, as it had all sorts of code and requires problem solving skills which lead me to choose to study IT.</p>
    <p>I chose to study at RMIT because of multiple reasons. Initially, RMIT was a last choice, as I had previously studied at the university before. But, because RMIT is a university that is known for its technology courses, it felt right to choose RMIT. Also, as I previously studied at RMIT and didn’t fully appreciate the university’s resources during that study, I wanted to appreciate and experience better to what RMIT has to provide.</p>
    <p>I expect to learn multiple skills in IT from my studies. Initially, IT to me meant programming, programming languages and all the colourful code, and just that. But, there’s more to IT then what I just mentioned. It’s learning how to compose and work as a team, how to solve problems efficiently, how to understand the world of IT, which doesn’t just stop at computers and all the hardware, but also what we use these technologies for and how to be innovative. It’s not just about programming but rather, learning to understand how each programming language works, as each has its own characteristics. Also, learning about what each programming language can be used for may help to determine which programming language will suit us. So, these are some of the skills I expect to learn from this course but more than expecting from the course, I expect myself to be determined to learn.</p>

    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    <img src="Ideal Job.png"></img>
    <p><a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/128706410675348166-software-engineer/?company=Google&company=YouTube&hl=en&hl=en&jlo=en-US&location=Sydney%20NSW,%20Australia">Job Advertisement</a></p>
    <p>Ideally, Google’s software engineer is a job position that I would like to achieve. Google, as we all know, is one of the largest search engines. So, the position is all about being able to be creative or think-outside-the-box and to also be able to adapt with the constantly evolving technology, and pouring these skills to create products for Google. I believe it would be fun to work in a company like Google because, from a few articles that I have read or come across, Google is a company that invests in their employees. I also am interested in becoming a software engineer to follow my father’s footsteps.</p>
    <p>In terms of qualifications, Google has provided two forms of qualifications, minimum qualifications and preferred qualifications. First, the minimum qualifications are to have graduated from and hold a bachelor’s degree in either Computer Science or a similar course, have had experience of, at least, four years in software development and to also be familiar and have experience with at least one of the programming languages, for example, Java, C or Python. Second, the preferred qualifications for the job states that the applicant, preferably, a master’s degree or a PhD in either Computer Science or a similar course, very familiar and experienced with a few programming languages like Java, C or Python, for example. It also states that the applicant should have an interest in learning other programming languages other than what they were familiar with.</p>
    <p>Currently, in terms of experience, I still have a long way to go and a ton to learn to be able to confidently apply for this position as I only know the basics of Java and Python. I also do not have prior experience in a field that is similar to Computer Science as I have not yet graduated and hold a degree from the course that I am currently studying. I plan to, first of all, complete my bachelor’s degree and start finding experience as a software developer, either as a trainee during my studies or apply for a first job in that field after I complete the bachelor’s degree. I also plan to learn and familiarise myself more with Java, C and Python to be able to confidently work with these programming languages. Personally, I would also like to work on my teamwork skills, as I believe these are some of the quality skills that Google seeks to find from their potential employees.</p>

    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
    <p>Online, there are numerous free tests that show results like, for example, personality, learning styles, creativity, etc. and results from these tests can help us determine how we interact socially and behave in workplace. Included are results from a few tests that I had taken:</p>
    <p>Myers-Briggs Test: INFP-T <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality">INFP-T Description</a></p>
    <p>Learning Style Test: Visual Learner</p>
    <p>Productivity Test: So, for this test, the results are calculated in three ranges, 16-36, 37-58 and 59-80. I received a score of 37-58, the middle range, and this result shows that I am able to be productive but I can definitely learn to be more productive.</p>
    <p>Personally, I do believe the results of the tests are quite accurate. Because, reading the description of the results, they do resonate with my personality and how I work. So, in terms of how these results affect my behaviour in a team, I believe I work well as the observant team member, compared to the leader in a team. However, as an observant team member, I don’t believe this means I prefer to slack-off, depend on other team members and show minimal contribution. I believe, although I prefer to be observant, a team will not deliver well and be as productive if a member or a few members choose to not contribute. So, as a team member, I have a responsibility to contribute to the best of my ability, and this includes, skills, communication and time, just to name a few.</p>

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Outfits, sometimes, it can be a headache to find the right outfit. Or, don’t you sometimes find it difficult trying to picture what the clothes you have in one website’s cart actually looks like with another? Or, maybe you’d like to see if what you already have in your wardrobe will suit the clothes you’re about to check-out online, you wouldn’t want your navy bell-bottomed pants to arrive only for you to realise, it doesn’t actually match that blouse you wanted to pair it up with. If there’s a way you can create outfits virtually, wouldn’t that be fun, save money and save time? So, with this in mind, the project idea is a simple app, that allows users, especially those who love the convenient idea of online shopping, to mix, match and create outfits from different websites and even their own wardrobe.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>Personally, often after online shopping and the order comes, I find myself feeling slightly disappointed because, sometimes, it’s either not what I initially expected or they’re quite difficult to match with other clothes. It won’t be a surprise if other online shoppers have had an experience or multiple experiences similar to this. Hence, the idea behind this app, a fun way that can help solve confusion about which item compliments which, what kind of outfits match and how can new items spruce up existing wardrobe.</p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>So, as the overview and motivation of the project idea had been discussed, a description of the project, in this case, the app, is next to discuss. In this description, the features of the app and what potential users of the app can expect will be discussed. Also, the potential obstacles or issues that can happen before and after the app is launched is another topic that will be covered.</p>
    <p>Firstly, the app’s layout will be pretty simple. It will have two sections, a “wardrobe” section and a section where the user will be able to drag the items they have chosen to mix and match and create outfits. “Wardrobe”, will be divided into the different clothing categories, tops, jackets, shorts, skirts, pants, dresses, shoes and accessories. Also, in the “wardrobe” section, is a separate section where the user will be able to keep items of clothing from their own wardrobe. It will be divided as so to allow users to easily navigate the app and easily pick the items of clothing.</p>
    <p>So, the lay-out of the app will be pretty simple. But, how can users place items of clothing in the app? It’s quite simple. Online, when a user looks through a website and chooses an item of clothing to look in more detail, it will take them to a page that focuses on the chosen item. In this page, users will be able to find a button with a picture of the app and this button acts as a link to the app. So, when users want to place the chosen item in “wardrobe”, they simply need to click on the link. It will automatically place the chosen item’s picture in “wardrobe”. Now, although the process sounds rather simple, the app will require co-operation with the business or company that owns the website.</p>
    <p>In the previous paragraphs, the lay-out of the app and the process for users was discussed. Next, as briefly mentioned, the app requires co-operation with the business and company. In order for the app to be able to link with the business’ or company’s website, it requires the business or company to allow the app to access the website. It will also require the business or company to provide a cut-out image of each product which will be attached to each link that is provided in each of the items of clothing’s focus page. So, these are some of the requirements of the app for businesses or companies who are willing to work with the app.</p>
    <p>In terms of obstacles, there can be a few and so, these are some of the obstacles or issues that can be faced. Firstly, although the app is simple to use, it may not interest the targeted market, online shoppers. In fact, some might find it more convenient to create their own outfit edits and some might not find the need to pre-create outfits before ordering the items. Secondly, as the app doesn’t have its own website for users to shop in, it requires businesses or companies to allow the app to work with them. Now, if businesses or companies are not interested about the app, or if business or companies does not find the benefits of working with the app, the app will find it difficult or will not be able to launch itself to the market. So, these are some of obstacles or issues that may affect the app’s launch and growth.</p>
    <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
    <p>MIT App Inventor will be used to create this app. Generally, in order to be able to use resources to create an app, multiple devices are needed to, not only use MIT App Inventor, but to also test out if it works well across all the different types of devices. It must suit and work well across the different types of devices, otherwise, users will find it inconvenient to use the app on a particular device.</p>
    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p>Now, to be able to produce this app, these are the skills that are required. It will require familiarity with how MIT App Inventor works to be able to produce the app itself. It will require familiarity and understanding of the concept of the app itself, and this is to avoid confusion about how the app will work or what the app will feature, for example. Although, overall, everyone who is able to manoeuvre their way through their device, definitely has the ability to create an app, so, it doesn’t require a high-level of expertise to start creating an app.</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>Overall, the purpose of this app is to create a fun and creative way to plan or create outfits with pre-purchased items and also, items from users’ existing wardrobe. It is created to reduce customer dissatisfaction regarding their online ordered items of clothing and allows users to work out what items they prefer to purchase as they are able to work out multiple different outfits before purchasing the items.</p>
